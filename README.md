# Project title: 
RadDiagnoses

## What and why?
I would love to try doing some diagnostic work on CT scans. It would have to be an ML client and we'd work with data from CT scans and common medical outcomes you'd see in them to determine whats most likely and output a list of likely diagnoses. This should make daignoses quicker for radiologists.

## For whom?
Radiologists

## How?
We'd have image data of commonly seen issues with CT scans and then would run a CT scan looking for similar formations. Over a ertain percent of siilarity (let's say 85%) it would return the name of that issue (disease or contusion, etc.)

## Scope
If this needed to actually be implemented 4-6 people would be far too little and we'd probably need at least 2 radiologists on board, particularly because accuracy is so key for medicine.
